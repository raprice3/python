    "# Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Written by Richard Price on February 3, 2022, updated February 11, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to programming and learning how to conduct data and statistical analysis in Python!  The purpose of these tutorials is to introduce you to Python programming in the Jupyter Notebook environment and teach practical skills to allow you to import, manipulate and analyze data and effectively communicate the results of your analysis.  The sample code in these tutorials can be adapted in other settings, and you will find a wealth of information online.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many, computer programming is unfamiliar and intimidating.  It is my belief that developing an understanding of basic programming concepts and actually doing some programming will make you a more capable employoee, give you confidence, and make you stand out from your peers.  I don't expect you will become an expert, but you may be surprised how quickly you can learn and do powerful things in Python. Most of what we will learn can be done in Excel and other software that doesn't require much programming knowledge, but you will see that some tasks are better suited to a programming environment that can handle datasets and conduct analysis that is not possible in Excel.  Other tasks, while possible to complete in Excel, are very inefficient.  If you find yourself repeating tasks, there may be a solution in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find that jumping back and forth between programs is the most practical way to use Python.  You may do some data manipulations in Excel and then import that data in Python for further analysis.  A powerful aspect of Python is the ability to quickly and efficiently repeat analysis for different time periods or samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you will enjoy being introduced to Python.  If you find you enjoy it, additional work on your own part will give you additional skills and proficiency.  The key to remembering what you learn is to continue to apply it.  Python is one of many possible software packages that can conduct data analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Install Anaconda and use Jupyter Notebook to run Python code\n",
    "1.  Use comments to provide documentation in code\n",
    "1.  Understand basic math functions in Python\n",
    "1.  Create and use variables to store information\n",
    "1.  Understand the following data types: `str`, `int`, `float`\n",
    "1.  Use the `type` function to determine the type of a variable, and the `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` functions to cast variables to another type\n",
    "1.  Understand lists and dictionaries, especially the similarities and differences between them\n",
    "1.  Understand how `for` loops and `if-else` statements can be used.\n",
    "1.  Understand how markdown can be used to format text in a notebook"

    "## 2. Python\n",
    "Python is a popular and powerful programming language that we will be using to clean, merge, and analyze data.  Python has a much broader use in software development, but our focus is on data analysis.  A major strength of Python is the size of the user community.  Python is open source software, meaning it is free to use.  Many packages have been written and are freely shared.  The capabilities of Python are on par with expensive proprietary software.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is widely used in practice, including in public accounting.  If you become familiar with Python, you could use it similar to how you use Excel, with a distinct advantage in its ability to analyze very large datasets quickly and efficiently and perform complex operations on the data.  There is a learning curve, and it requires you to learn some computer programming.  Some may find this intimidating, which is natural.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we proceed, it is my objective that you understand the process of obtaining, cleaning, merging, analyzing, and interpreting data.  The process is the same regardless of the specific software package or programming language you use, though the syntax and tools will differ.  Gaining experience in any language or software package will make you a better decision maker and a better communicator, and it will make it easier for you to learn other software or programming languages.  You will understand the process of data analytics and will be able to better communicate with those actually doing the programming and can have reasonable expecations as to what can be done.  If you continue to use Python, you will become more comfortable and capable using it and it will benefit you in your career."

    "### Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways to install and interact with Python.  We will be using Anaconda, which is a powerful and popular data science platform.  You can download and install the 64 bit version of Anaconda at https://www.anaconda.com/ on any operating system.  __Go ahead and download and install the individual edition of Anaconda.__  [Here is a link to a tutorial with indstructions for installing Anaconda on Windows and Mac computers.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cts9AiX2IgX4Or3JRawud7zdIwp_oEKp6pujCcAYBCQ/edit?usp=sharing)"

    "## 3. Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter Notebook, which is program that provides a way to interact with many different programming languages.  It was developed specifically for the following languages: <u>Ju</u>lia, <u>Pyt</u>hon, and <u>R</u>, and the name Ju-Pyt-R comes from those three languages.  We will be using Jupyter Notebook to interact with Python.  It is most commonly used on a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are organized as a series of cells that hold one of the following types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    " - __markdown__, which is text written to document what you are doing.  What you're reading right now is markdown.\n",
    " - __code__, which you can run to generate output and complete tasks\n",
    " - __raw__ format (which has no formatting and is not interpreted as code, but appears formatted as code, infrequently used, could be helpful as a way to comment out or deactivate code cells)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are an efficient way to record your work as you can include annotations, code, and output all in the same document.  It is easy to share reports, code, and data to others who may want to review your work, or be able to easily replicate or extend any analysis you have done."

    "### Using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Using a Jupyter Notebook is fairly intuitive.  If you want to edit a cell, the enter key will place the cursor in the cell (and change the color from blue to green indicating you are editing).  If you want to navigate to a different cell, the escape key will remove the cursor and turn the cell color back to blue, and you can navigate to different cells using the up and down arrows, or using the keys \"j\" to go down a cell and \"k\" to go up a cell (which are also shortcuts to navigate messages in Gmail).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shortcut Keys in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many keyboard shortcuts that make navigating and writing efficient.  Here are a few key shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - `enter` when cell is selected (blue) in command mode, enter cell to edit (will turn green)\n",
    " - `esc` when cell is in edit mode (green), exit to select mode (will turn from green to blue)\n",
    " - `shift + enter` run cell, select cell below\n",
    " - `ctrl + enter` run cell, keep current cell selected\n",
    " - `alt + enter` run cell, insert new cell below\n",
    " - `a` insert cell above\n",
    " - `b` insert cell below\n",
    " - `d d` delete cell\n",
    " - `c` copy cell\n",
    " - `v` paste cell\n",
    " - `shift + m` merge selected cells, or current cell with cell below if only one cell selected  \n",
    "\n",
    "To see other keyboard shortcuts, you can go to the Help menu and select Keyboard Shortcuts, or you can type `h` if the cell is in command mode (blue), otherwise you are editing a cell and you will simply enter the letter h."

    "\n",
    "It is important to document your work.  Jupyter Notebook makes it easy using markdown cells (the formatted cells in this notebook preceding this cell), which are used for documentation of analysis and presentation of results.  You will also want to include documentation along with your code using comments.  Comments are ignored by the interpreter and have the sole purpose of informing the reader (which may be future you wondering what the old you was thinking). Comments are added using a hashtag at the beginning of a line.\n",

    "The next cell is a code cell, which is formatted differently with fixed-width font, which is standard in computer programming.  Your code cells will hold your code statements but along with any comments you include.  To execute the code in a cell, you have the following options:\n",
    "- type `control+enter` to run the selected cell and remain in tat cell (on a Mac it is `command+enter`)\n",
    "- type `shift+enter` to run the selected sell and move to the next cell\n",

The `<u>` is a beginning tag indicating the beginning of where we want text to be underlined and `</u>` is an ending tag indicating the end of underlined text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use tags for <b>bold</b> font (the tags are `<b>` and `</b>`) and <i>italics</i> (the tags are `<i>` and `</i>`).  We can create bulleted or unordered lists (the tags are `<ul>` and `</ul>`), and numbered or ordered lists (the tags are `<ol>` and `</ol>`); list items are indicated with the tags `<li>` and `</li>` in both unordered and ordered lists.  However, the above method of using a hyphen `-` for bulleted lists or `1.` for ordered lists are much simpler. To illustrate, to create the bulleted list shown above with `accounting` as one item and `rules!` as another, we type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>accounting</li>\n",
    "        <li>rules!</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine syntax.  For example, to write ___accounting rules!___ in bold and italics, we can type `___accounting rules!___` with three underscores before and after.  To add underlined text for ___<u>accounting rules!</u>___, we can add the underline tags as follows: `___<u>accounting rules!</u>___`.  Or we could use tags as follows: `<u><b><i>accounting rules!</i></b></u>`.  (I agree the options seem more confusing than helpful.)"
